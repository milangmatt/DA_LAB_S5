Weka is an open source software providing tools for data preprocessing, implementation of several Machine Learning algorithms and visualization tools so as to develop machine learning techniques and apply them to real-world data mining problems

It provides the following options
  
- Preprocessing of Data
- Classification of Data
- Clustering of Data
- Association 
- Attribute Selection
- Visualization

The Weka GUI chooser application allows to run five different types of application as listed:

- Explore
- Experimenter
- Work Bench
- Simple CLI
- Knowledge Flow


### Preprocess Tab

The Preprocess tab in Weka is used to load and manipulate datasets. It allows users to view and edit the data, as well as apply filters to preprocess the data. This tab provides various options for data transformation, such as handling missing values, normalizing data, and converting data types.

### Classify Tab

The Classify tab in Weka is used to train and test machine learning models on a given dataset. It allows users to select from a variety of classification algorithms, such as decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines, and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. This tab also provides options for model selection, cross-validation, and output visualization.

### Cluster Tab

The Cluster tab in Weka is used to group similar data points into clusters based on their attributes. It allows users to select from various clustering algorithms, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering, and evaluate their performance using metrics like silhouette coefficient and Calinski-Harabasz index. This tab also provides options for cluster visualization and analysis.

### Associate Tab

The Associate tab in Weka is used to discover patterns and relationships in the data. It allows users to apply association rule learning algorithms, such as Apriori and Eclat, to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules. This tab provides options for rule filtering, visualization, and analysis, enabling users to gain insights into the underlying patterns in the data.

### Select Attribute Tab

The Select Attribute tab in Weka is used to select a subset of attributes from the dataset. It allows users to choose the most relevant attributes for their analysis, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the data and improving the performance of machine learning models. This tab provides various options for attribute selection, such as correlation-based selection, information gain-based selection, and wrapper-based selection.

### Visualize Tab

The Visualize tab in Weka is used to visualize the data in various formats, such as scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms. It allows users to gain insights into the distribution of the data, identify patterns and relationships, and understand the characteristics of the data. This tab provides options for customizing the visualization, such as selecting the attributes to plot, choosing the plot type, and adjusting the plot settings.

Data can be loaded from different sources:
- Local file system
- Web
- Database
- Generated database

It supports a large number of file formats including: 

- ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format)
- CSV (Comma Separated Values)
- Excel files (.xls, .xlsx)
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- LibSVM (Library for Support Vector Machines)
- ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
- PostgreSQL database
- SQL database
- Text files (.txt)
- XRFF (eXtensible Attribute-Relation File Format)

Some sample weka datasets are:
- iris.arff
- glass.arff
- cpu.arff
- ionosphere.arff
- weather.arff
